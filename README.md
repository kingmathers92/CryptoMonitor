# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Todos:

1- Adding show and hide password in account panel.
2- Adding the scroll-to-top every time page change and fixed the search crypto search bar until the bottom of 10th coin.
3- Add forget password bot ,so that user can recover there password if it forget.
4-Adding loading screen everytime pages render & pagination upto 25 pages.
5- Making a new page for trending coins too..

6)When a user is logged in and opens the hamburger menu(nav menu on smaller screens). It still gives the options of the user signing up/sign in. Update this so that it only displays Home, Account and Logout options if a user is logged in.

7)This is still in regards to the mobile view (smaller screens). Its a bit repetitive to have the account /signout options in the main nav bar if those options are available after pressing the hamburger icon. once again this is only for mobile screen sizes. I completely removed it on only let it appear if you press the hamburger menu icon. I left it as is for the larger screen.
